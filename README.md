## How is this going to work?
1. Dwigt takes a photo of a maze drawn on a paper and hands it over to Michael
2. Michael hands over the picture to Pam, who decodes it using a special language and faxes it to the one and only Kevin Malone, who will crunch the numbers and figure out a way around that maze, then fax the directions right to Michael
3. Michael, geared  asks Stanley to go down to the warehouse and tell Darryl how to solve the maze
4. Darryl gets in his forklift and drives through the maze, using the instructions that have been given to him

|Codename|The actual thing|Its purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Dwigt|my old phone|serves as a network webcam|
|Michael|node.js server Raspberry PI|serves as a sort of a controler for the whole operation|
|[Pam](https://github.com/hendrychjan/kevin/tree/main/components/img-convert)|shell script ig, idk yet|decodes the picture into a form that can be fed into the maze solver|
|Kevin|an algorithm in C|determines a way around the maze, using Dijkstra's algorithm|
|Stanley|interface between Pi and the Lego controller|somehow feeds the solution instructions to the Lego Mindstorms controller|
|Darryl|a Lego Mindstorms controller|takes the solution and controls the drawing arm|
|Darryl's forklift|motor-cnc-with-a-pen-thing|draws the solution back on the paper|
